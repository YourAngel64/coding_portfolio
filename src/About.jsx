                    Hello! Welcome! This is me, Angel Vazquez. A 17 years old programmer and 
                    designer which has unconditional love for technology! I do mainly concentrate
                    on software, low-level programming. But Within my skills I do also do
                    Graphic Design and Web Applications.
                </p>

                <p className="about">
                    I graduated from Legacy Preparatory Charter Academy in Mesquite Texas,
                    I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science Degree in Florida State University.

                <h2 className="heading">Background...</h2>

                <p className="about">
                    I was born and raised in the state of Puerto Rico. Grew up speaking both
                    Spanish and English equally with a love for video games. Later in my life I moved
                    to Texas during my teen years.  
                </p>

                <p className="about">
                    This love for video games became a motivation
                    to start coding and dig myself in the world of Computer Science as soon as I turned 16.
                </p>

                <p className="about">
                    Now I spend my time learning new skills, improving my critical thinking through software and dev development.
                    I specialized in low level languages such as C, C++, Rust and Assembly x86_64
